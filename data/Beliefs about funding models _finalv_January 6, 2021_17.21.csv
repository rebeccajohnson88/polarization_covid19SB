This information sheet outlines the purpose of the study and provides a description of your involvement and rights as a participant, if you agree to take part.



1. What is the research about?

We want to know what people think about different ways of getting money to small businesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, local governments have used different approaches to deciding which businesses get help. We want to know what you think about these different programs. 



2. Do I have to take part?

No, you don't. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. You do not have to take part if you do not want to. 



3. What will my involvement be?

This survey takes about 5 minutes. You will need to read instructions and answer some multiple choice and rank-order questions. There are 3 open-ended questions where you have to briefly write/explain an answer. 



4. How do I withdraw from the study?

You can withdraw from the study at any point until you have completed the survey, without having to give a reason. If any questions make you feel uncomfortable, you can stop answering. We will not analyze any incomplete responses, so if you stop the survey before the end, your responses will not be included in any analyses or reports.  



5. What will my information be used for?

I will use the survey responses for an academic paper. I may also share my findings in research talks, reports, blog posts, etc. 



6. Will my taking part and my data be kept confidential? Will it be anonymised?

Your data will be anonymised – you do not give your name so your responses can not be matched back to you. The data will be posted on a website where other researchers can analyze it to check my results or test their own hypotheses. Before it is posted, Prolific IDs and IP addresses will be deleted. 



8. Who has reviewed this study?

This study has undergone ethics review in accordance with the LSE Research Ethics Policy and Procedure.

This, in my mind is discriminatory because there could be a male owned business that really needs the money, but the money could instead go to a female owned business that has suffered less losses simply because they are headed by a female. I think that the best way to do it is to simply look at the losses and the need and make determinations based on that.

Say a woman owned company gets a contract simply for that reason of being a woman owned business.  You may see a lot of partnering up of companies purely for the sake of getting the contract.  Example, a woman might not be interested in a business or contract at at all.  The contract male owned company knows about the contract, how lucrative it is, but can't get it because it's mandated for a woman company.  That may lead to them partnering up so that the woman owned company will get the contract, but the man owned company will be responsible for servicing it.  So in that case, should the woman owned company be really giving an advantage?  I would verbalize this better as writing it may seem kind of harsh, but I've seen it.
